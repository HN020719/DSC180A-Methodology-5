## Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic I explored this quarter was the creation of polygenic risk scores (PRS) using multiple cohort data. This experience was particularly interesting because we utilized multi-ancestry data to improve the accuracy of risk prediction in different populations. Additionally, we have attempted to make predictions at the individual level, which adds complexity and gives us a deeper understanding of how genetic variation affects personalized health outcomes. This work demonstrates the value of combining data from multiple populations to reduce genetic prediction bias and improve the overall validity of PRS models.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
In the Q2 project, I aim to explore the application of advanced machine learning models in genomic data analysis, especially in improving polygenic risk scores (PRS). Current polygenic risk score models rely heavily on simple linear regression, which, while effective to some extent, may not fully capture the complexity of gene interactions. My goal is to investigate how non-linear models such as neural networks or random forests can be applied to more accurately predict genetic risk factors and enable more precise disease prediction.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One potential change I would like to make to our approach is to first decide whether we should focus on predicting a specific disease or keep a more generalized approach. This decision is important due to the limitations of our current dataset.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
After completing the genetic risk prediction section, I will be interested in exploring how integrating environmental factors can enhance our model. Incorporating non-genetic data, such as exposure to pollutants, lifestyle factors, or socioeconomic conditions, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease risk. Additionally, I am interested in the potential to develop LLM-based health agents that can provide personalized insights and recommendations to individuals.
