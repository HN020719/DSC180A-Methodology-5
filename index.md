## Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic has been exploring the applications of machine learning models to genomic data analysis. Understanding how these models can predict genetic risk factors and enhance precision medicine is fascinating.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to explore how polygenic risk scores can be improved using multi-ancestry datasets. This could involve leveraging deep learning techniques to refine predictions for underrepresented populations.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In Quarter 1, we primarily used linear models for genetic risk prediction. For Quarter 2, I’d consider incorporating non-linear models like random forests or neural networks to capture complex interactions between genetic variants.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze scientific literature related to genetic risk factors, which could help identify novel associations and potential biomarkers.
